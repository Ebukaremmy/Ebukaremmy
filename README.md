## 🚀 One-line pitch
I am a learner of the **ALX Backend program**, transitioning from Electrical & Electronic Engineering into backend software engineering. I’m passionate about building reliable systems that solve practical problems — especially projects that support agriculture and local businesses.

---

## 🧾 About / Why I started software engineering
<details>
<summary><strong>Short story</strong></summary>

I started software engineering because I want to turn practical problems into simple, scalable digital solutions. My background in Electrical/Electronic Engineering taught me how systems interact — now I want to bring that systems thinking to backend development: APIs, databases, and resilient services.

</details>

---

## 🎯 What inspires me / my passion
- Solving real-world problems (e.g., reducing post-harvest losses for smallholder farmers).  
- Building clean, maintainable APIs and data pipelines.  
- Learning by doing — prototyping, testing, and iterating quickly.

---

## 🌟 Vision
> **My aim is to build backend systems that are reliable, scalable, and easy to maintain — systems that help small businesses and communities perform better.**

---

## 🔭 Projects I want to work on
> *Examples / placeholders — replace with your actual project ideas or repo links*

- **CropLink** — A simple backend service to track produce from farm to market, with APIs for inventory and expiration alerts.  
- **Auth & Microservice Patterns** — Microservice examples demonstrating authentication, rate limiting, and retries.  
- **Data ETL for Small Businesses** — Pipelines to aggregate, clean, and analyze transactional data for market insights.

---

## 🛠️ Tech / Tools I’m focusing on
- **Languages:** Python (coming soon), Bash basics  
- **Databases:** PostgreSQL, basic SQL concepts  
- **DevOps basics:** Docker, Git, CI/CD pipelines (learning)  
- **Concepts:** RESTful APIs, data flow, system design

> *(Tip: replace the placeholders above with specific repos or badges as you complete projects.)*

---

## 🧩 How I learn (my learning style)
I’m a **Kinesthetic (INTJ)** learner — I learn best by doing. That’s why my repos will focus on small, practical projects you can run locally and experiment with.

---

## 🛣️ Roadmap / What you’ll see here soon
- Beginner-friendly backend projects with README walkthroughs so you can run them locally.  
- A “learning notebook” repo with explanations, diagrams, and commands I used (bash pipelines, DB queries).  
- Small case study: *CropLink* — architecture diagram, API endpoints, and sample data.

---

## 🤝 Collaboration & contributions
I’m open to collaboration — especially on projects that affect agriculture, logistics, or small businesses.  
If you want to work together:
- ⭐ Star a repo to follow progress
- 🐛 Open an issue or drop me a DM / email (see Contact below)
- 👥 Suggest features or small tasks I can pick up to learn faster
